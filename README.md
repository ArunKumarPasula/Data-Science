Customer Churn Prediction - Binary Classification
Description:
As we know,Churn prediction is one of the most popular Big Data use cases in business. It consists of detecting customers who are likely to cancel a subscription to a service.There are a number of things you can do to improve customer retention overall. But individualized customer retention is difficult because businesses usually have a lot of customers and cannot afford to spend much time on one. The costs would be too high and would outweigh the extra revenue. 

However, if you could predict in advance which customers are at risk of leaving, you could reduce customer retention efforts by directing them solely toward such customers.This is exactly is the theme of this project “if you could somehow predict in advance which customers are at risk of leaving, you could reduce customer retention”.

Here,we build a model(s),which predicts how likely a customer cancels the subscription or service.We leverage various machine learning models in python scikit-learn library.

We will go through various tasks like data wrangling,fitting various models to the data and analyzing results using various metrics.
