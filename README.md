##Customer Churn Prediction - Binary Classification
###objective: 
To build a machine learning model that can predictly how likely a customer unsubscribes or leaves a service.
###Required Software:
Anaconda distribution for python with the libraries (scikit-learn,pandas,matplotlib etc.) installed
###Description:
As we know,Churn prediction is one of the most popular Big Data use cases in business. It consists of detecting customers who are likely to cancel a subscription to a service.There are a number of things you can do to improve customer retention overall. But individualized customer retention is difficult because businesses usually have a lot of customers and cannot afford to spend much time on one. The costs would be too high and would outweigh the extra revenue. 

However, if you could predict in advance which customers are at risk of leaving, you could reduce customer retention efforts by directing them solely toward such customers.This is exactly is the theme of this project “if you could somehow predict in advance which customers are at risk of leaving, you could reduce customer retention”.

Here,we build a model(s),which predicts how likely a customer cancels the subscription or service.We leverage various machine learning models in python scikit-learn library.

We will go through various tasks like data wrangling,fitting various models to the data and analyzing results using various metrics.

##LOAN DEFAULTERS-CREDIT RISK
###objective:
build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not.
###Required Software:
Anaconda distribution for python with the libraries (scikit-learn,pandas,matplotlib etc.) installed.
###Description:
Credit risk analysis (finance risk analysis, loan default risk analysis) and credit risk management is important to financial institutions which provide loans to businesses and individuals. Credit can occur for various reasons: bank mortgages (or home loans), motor vehicle purchase finances, credit card purchases, installment purchases, and so on. 

Credit loans and finances have risk of being defaulted or delinquent. To understand risk levels of credit users, credit providers normally collect vast amount of information on borrowers. Statistical predictive analytic techniques can be used to analyze or to determine risk levels involved on credits, finances, and loans, i.e., default risk levels. 

Personal credit scores are normally computed from information available in credit reports collected by external credit bureaus and ratings agencies. Credit scores may indicate personal financial history and current situation. However, it does not tell you exactly what constitutes a "good" score from a "bad" score. More specifically, it does not tell you the level of risk for the lending you may be considering

We will go through various tasks like data wrangling,fitting various models to the data and analyzing results using various metrics.We will dive more into Logistic Regression model
